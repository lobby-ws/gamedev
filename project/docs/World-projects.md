# World Projects

Hyperfy world projects are normal Node projects that contain only game code and assets. They are synced to a running world via the app-server and can be deployed explicitly for staging/production.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scaffold a new project
npx gamedev init

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local world + continuous sync
npm run dev
```

The scaffolded `package.json` includes `gamedev` and `typescript` as devDependencies.
Built-in apps and a default `$scene` entry are included in `apps/` and `world.json`.

## Project Layout

```
apps/                       App scripts + blueprint JSON (defaults)
assets/                     Local assets referenced by blueprints
dist/apps/                  Built app bundles (generated, gitignored)
world.json                  World layout + per-instance overrides
tsconfig.json               TypeScript config (points at `gamedev` types)
.lobby/targets.json         Local-only deploy targets (gitignored)
.lobby/targets.example.json  Shareable template for targets
.claude/skills/             Claude Code skill docs for app scripting
```

## What to Edit

- `apps/<AppName>/index.ts` (or `index.js`) for scripts.
- `apps/<AppName>/*.json` for blueprint defaults (props, model, flags).
- `world.json` for layout and per-instance overrides.
- `assets/` for local files referenced by props/blueprints.

## What Not to Edit

- `dist/` is generated by the bundler.
- `.lobby/<worldId>/` is local runtime state.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` is per-developer.

## Claude Code

The scaffold includes `.claude/skills/hyperfy-app-scripting/SKILL.md` to guide app scripting tasks. Commit the skill folder, and keep local Claude settings in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored).

## Targets and Deploys

- Use `.lobby/targets.json` for local targets (dev/staging/prod).
- Commit `.lobby/targets.example.json` as the shareable template.
- Use `gamedev dev` for continuous sync (dev only).
- Use `gamedev apps deploy <app>` for explicit staging/prod deploys.

## Existing Worlds

If you need to pull an existing world into a local project (including scripts):

```bash
gamedev world export --include-built-scripts
```

## Scripting Reference

Use the scripting docs for runtime APIs and lifecycle:

- `docs/scripting/README.md`
- `docs/scripting/app/App.md`
- `docs/scripting/world/World.md`
